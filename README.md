# NumPy MLP for MNIST

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-blue)

This is an ongoing project to build a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network entirely from scratch using only NumPy. The core objective is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Goal

The primary aim of this project is to gain a deep, fundamental understanding of how neural networks operate. This involves implementing all core components – from forward and backward passes to activation functions, loss calculations, and optimizers – without relying on the high-level abstractions provided by deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for the model's definition and training process.

## Current Status

This project is under active development
